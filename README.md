Daily Grind

## What am I going to do today?
I am going to spend time on deploying a simple hello page made with php on github as a test on how it's done for the upcoming weekend project.

## What went wrong?
I tried to get into aws/azure, but they required a phone number I was not able to provide and couldn't get ahold of their support except bots.
